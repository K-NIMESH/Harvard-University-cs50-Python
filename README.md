___
### Problem Set 0: Functions, Variables 
___
#### 1. Indoor Voice

The a file called indoor.py, implements a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 

#### 2. Playback Speed

The file called playback.py, implements a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

#### 3. Making Faces

The file called faces.py, implements a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.

#### 4. Einstein

The file called einstein.py, implements a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

#### 5. Tip Calculator

The file called tip.py, implements a program in Python that prompts the user for a dollar amount and a percentage. Those values are converted into data types that can be evaluated together and produce a tip value. (i.e., $10.00 * 10% = $1.00)
___

### Problem Set 1: Conditionals

___
#### 1. Deep Thought

The file called deep.py, implements a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.

#### 2. Home Federal Savings Bank

The file called bank.py, implements a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with ‚Äúhello‚Äù, output $0. If the greeting starts with an ‚Äúh‚Äù (but not ‚Äúhello‚Äù), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. The program will ignore any leading whitespace in the user‚Äôs greeting, and treat the user‚Äôs greeting case-insensitively.

#### 3. File Extensions

The file called extensions.py, implements a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file‚Äôs media type if the file‚Äôs name ends, case-insensitively, in any of the common media type suffix. If the file‚Äôs name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, the program will output application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.

#### 4. Math Interpreter

The file called interpreter.py, implements a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. 

#### 4. Meal Time

The file called meal.py, implements a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time.
